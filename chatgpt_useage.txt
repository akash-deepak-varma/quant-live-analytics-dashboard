ChatGPT was used occasionally as a technical reference tool during the development of this project.
Its usage was limited to clarifying Python syntax, improving documentation structure, and suggesting best practices for modular design.
All critical components — including data ingestion, analytics computation, alerts, and Streamlit integration — were independently designed, implemented, and tested by the author.

Example Prompts Used

“How to structure a Python project with separate frontend and backend directories?”

“Fix cannot access local variable 'time' error in a multithreaded Python module.”

“Explain how to handle live data updates gracefully in Streamlit.”

“Provide a short, professional ChatGPT usage transparency statement for a report.”
